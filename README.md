# quarkus-demo-action

This is a sample app to show how to use GitHub Actions to 
- build in native mode
- put the exectuable in a Docker image
- publish the docker image to a remote registry
- deploy it on GCP with Cloud Run

I wrote an article on Medium about this process : https://medium.com/@max.day/how-to-use-github-actions-to-deploy-your-quarkus-app-to-gcp-6ed5d9fdecb3
